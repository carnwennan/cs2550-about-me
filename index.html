                This is about the time I was pranking some fish, then had the same prank pulled on me without realizing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I walk by the pond,<br>
                startling fish, then glance as<br>
                birds fly overhead

            <h2> Personal interests </h2>
            <p>
                I spend much of my personal time playing games. 
                I find they are a good way to relax and spend time with people; I play lots of board games with my family and video games with my friends.
                Having a grip of cards or controller in my hand always makes me feel more comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not playing games, I'm often thinking about them.
                Board game design is my primary creative outlet.
                I've designed several games, but few have been any good.
                Hopefully after testing them at Protocon 2025 this year, that will have changed!
            </p>
            <p>
                I spend most of productive and free time listening to music (except during class!).
                I mostly like electronic and ambient stuff, as well as certain indie pop and indie rock acts. 
                Some of my favorite albums are 
                <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/boris/flood/">Flood</a> by Boris,
                <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/justice/%E2%80%A0-cross/">&#10013;</a> by Justice, and
                <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/the-wicked-farleys/make-it-it/">Make It It</a> by the Wicked Farleys.
